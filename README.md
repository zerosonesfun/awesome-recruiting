## Boolean and X-ray

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

[Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_expression) searching is a method of symbolic logic developed by George Boole, a 19th century English mathematician. Boolean searches allow you to combine words and phrases using the words AND, OR, NOT (known as Boolean operators) to limit, broaden, or define your search. This type of searching is also referred to as a x-ray search.
